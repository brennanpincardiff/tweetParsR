We need these packages to make package generation work...
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library("devtools")
library("roxygen2")
library("testthat")
library("knitr")
```

## Package created and function edited. 
I have added some documentation but it's very light.
To create documentation, run this:
```{r document, echo=TRUE}
devtools::document()
```

## Description edited to add imports
Need to add more details here.


## Check Build
Can do this via the Build tab of RStudio or use the console

```{r check}
devtools::check()
```

## Need to add some tests
Need some specifications and some data...

```{r test}
devtools::test()
```
